üöÇ Ticket Booking System: A Java Masterpiece by Puja Yadav

Welcome to the Ticket Booking System, a console-based train reservation powerhouse crafted with pure Java brilliance! This project is not just an application‚Äîit‚Äôs a testament to my journey of mastering core Java concepts, conquering complex programming challenges, and building a robust, feature-rich system from the ground up.

Dive into this repository to witness how I transformed raw Java knowledge into a fully functional train ticket booking system, complete with user authentication, train search, seat booking, and persistent data storage. Buckle up‚Äîthis README will take you through the project‚Äôs awesomeness, my learning adventure, and why this is a shining beacon of my programming prowess! üöÄ

üåü Project Overview: What‚Äôs This All About?
Key Features That‚Äôll Blow Your Mind:

**Secure User Authentication**: Sign up with a unique username and password, securely hashed using BCrypt for top-notch security. Login is smooth and case-insensitive, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
**Train Search Magic:** Search for trains between any source and destination, with results pulled from a JSON-based train database. The system intelligently validates routes based on station order.
**Seat Booking Bliss:** Book a specific seat on your chosen train, with real-time seat availability checks. Already booked? No worries‚Äîthe system‚Äôs got you covered with clear error messages.
**Booking Management:** View all your bookings with detailed ticket information or cancel a ticket by ID, all persisted across sessions.
**Persistent Data Storage:** User and train data are stored in JSON files (data/users.json and data/trains.json), ensuring your bookings and account details are safe even after you exit.
Error-Proof Design: Robust input validation and exception handling prevent crashes, making the application as reliable as a high-speed train! üöÑ


üõ†Ô∏è How I Built This: A Java Learning Odyssey

**1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The Blueprint of Brilliance**

Classes and Objects: I designed modular classes like User, Train, and Ticket, each encapsulating specific responsibilities. This ensured clean, reusable code.
Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters/setters (e.g., in User) protected data integrity while allowing controlled access.
Abstraction: The UserBookingService and TrainService classes abstract complex logic (e.g., file operations, seat booking) behind simple method calls, making the codebase maintainable.
Polymorphism: Stream operations and method overloading in UserBookingService allowed flexible data processing, showcasing Java‚Äôs dynamic capabilities.

**2. File I/O and JSON Mastery**

I harnessed Java‚Äôs file handling (java.io.File) to read and write user and train data to data/users.json and data/trains.json.
Using the Jackson library (jackson-databind:2.17.2), I mastered JSON serialization and deserialization, mapping JSON data to Java objects with precision.
I implemented robust error handling to create directories and initialize empty files if they didn‚Äôt exist, ensuring seamless data persistence.

**3. Exception Handling: No Crash Zone**

I wrapped critical operations (file I/O, user input) in try-catch blocks to handle IOExceptions, NumberFormatExceptions, and more, making the application bulletproof.
Custom error messages guide users through invalid inputs (e.g., booking an already reserved seat), enhancing the user experience.

**4. Collections Framework: Data Powerhouse**

I used List<User>, List<Train>, and List<List<Integer>> (for seats) to manage dynamic data efficiently.
Stream API operations (e.g., filter, findFirst) in UserBookingService.loginUser and TrainService.searchTrains optimized data retrieval with elegant, functional-style code.

**5. Security with BCrypt**

I integrated the BCrypt library (org.mindrot:jbcrypt:0.4) to hash passwords securely, ensuring user credentials are protected.
The UserServiceUtil class demonstrates my ability to implement secure authentication, a critical feature for any real-world application.

**6. Input/Output Handling**

I mastered Java‚Äôs Scanner class to create a responsive console interface, handling both numeric and string inputs with care.
By consuming newlines (scanner.nextLine() after nextInt()), I eliminated common input bugs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**7. Modular Design and Dependency Management**

The project is structured into packages (org.example.Services, org.example.entities, org.example.util) for clarity and scalability.
Gradle (build.gradle) manages dependencies and enforces JDK 21 compatibility, showcasing my ability to configure professional build systems.

Every feature in this project reflects a core Java concept mastered through hands-on practice, debugging, and iteration. From wrestling with JSON deserialization errors to perfecting user input validation, I transformed challenges into opportunities to grow as a Java developer.


**Complexity Conquered:** I built a multi-feature system with user authentication, data persistence, and real-time seat management, tackling real-world complexity with clean code.
**Problem-Solving Prowess:** From fixing input mismatches to resolving file path issues, I debugged and optimized the application to run flawlessly.
**Scalable Design:** The modular architecture (services, entities, utilities) makes it easy to add features like a GUI, database, or multi-user support.
**Attention to Detail:** User-friendly prompts, case-insensitive logins, and robust error handling show my commitment to a polished user experience.
**Production-Ready Skills:** Secure password hashing, JSON persistence, and Gradle configuration demonstrate my ability to build professional-grade software.


**Ready to see the Ticket Booking System in action? Follow these steps to run it on your machine:
Prerequisites**

JDK 21 or later (I tested with JDK 24 for cutting-edge performance)
Gradle 8.10.2 (or let Gradle Wrapper handle it)
Git (to clone the repo)

Setup

1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/AtharvaKumar/Ticket_Booking_System.git
cd Ticket_Booking_System


2. Prepare Data Files:

The data directory contains trains.json (train data) and users.json (user data).
If data/users.json is missing, the application creates an empty one ([]).
Ensure data/trains.json is populated (included in the repo).


3. Run the Application:
./gradlew run


4. Interact with the System:

Choose options 1‚Äì7 from the menu.
Try signing up, logging in, searching for trains (e.g., Bangalore to Delhi), booking a seat, and managing bookings.
Watch the magic unfold in the console! üòé



**Example Workflow**

Select 1 to sign up (e.g., username: atharva, password: honuman).
Select 2 to log in with the same credentials.
Select 4 to search trains (e.g., source: bangalore, destination: delhi).
Select 5 to book a seat (e.g., row 1, column 1).
Select 3 to view bookings or 6 to cancel one.

üìö Tech Stack: The Tools of a Java Titan

Java 21: The backbone of the project, leveraging modern Java features.
Jackson 2.17.2: For seamless JSON serialization/deserialization.
BCrypt 0.4: For secure password hashing.

Gradle: For dependency management and build automation.
JSON Files: Lightweight, file-based persistence for users and trains.

üöÄ Future Enhancements: The Sky‚Äôs the Limit
While the Ticket Booking System is a fully functional masterpiece, I‚Äôm always thinking ahead. Here are some exciting features I could add to take it to the next level:

GUI with JavaFX: Transform the console app into a sleek, visual interface.
Database Integration: Replace JSON files with SQLite or MySQL for scalability.
Multi-User Support: Add concurrent booking with file locking or a server.
Unit Tests: Implement JUnit tests for bulletproof reliability.
